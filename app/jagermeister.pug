    .page-subTitle My Role
    .page-text As an event producer my first responsobility was general project budgeting. Also, I organised and managed the event realization teams: creative, technical, directors and project managers team. Working on execution of the project itself, I was in control of the set up and take down, and numerous supporting roles of contractors. It was a busy role, but everything worked out well and our team put on a successful evening.
